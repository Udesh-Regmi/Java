# 🔥 **Type Promotion in Expressions in Java**  

**Type Promotion** in Java is the automatic conversion of **smaller data types** into **larger ones** when used in expressions to prevent **data loss** and maintain consistency.  

---

## 📌 **Rules of Type Promotion in Java**  

1️⃣ **All byte, short, and char values are promoted to int** if used in an arithmetic operation.  
2️⃣ **If one operand is long, float, or double, the whole expression is promoted to the largest data type in the expression.**  
3️⃣ **Boolean values (`true` and `false`) are NOT type-promoted.**  
4️⃣ **Explicit casting is required when assigning a higher data type to a lower one.**

## ✅ **Examples of Type Promotion**  

### 🔹 **Rule 1: Byte, Short, and Char are Promoted to Int**
```java
public class TypePromotionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        byte b = 10;
        short s = 20;
        char c = 'A';  // ASCII value of 'A' = 65
        
        int result = b + s + c;  // All promoted to int
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);  // Output: 95
    }
}
```
✔ **All operands (`byte`, `short`, `char`) are automatically converted to `int` before performing addition.**  

---

### 🔹 **Rule 2: If One Operand is Long, Float, or Double, the Whole Expression is Promoted**
```java
public class TypePromotionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 100;
        long l = 5000L;
        float f = 10.5f;
        double d = 50.25;

        double result = i + l + f + d;  // Promoted to double
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);  // Output: 5160.25
    }
}
```
✔ The **expression follows the largest operand (`double`) and promotes all values to `double`**.  

---

### 🔹 **Rule 3: Boolean Values are NOT Promoted**
```java
public class TypePromotionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean flag = true;
        // int result = flag + 1;  // ❌ ERROR: boolean cannot be promoted to int
    }
}
```
✔ **Boolean cannot be part of arithmetic expressions!**  

---

### 🔹 **Rule 4: Explicit Casting Required When Assigning a Higher Type to a Lower One**
```java
public class TypePromotionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 10;
        float f = 5.5f;
        
        int result = (int) (i + f);  // Explicit cast needed
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);  // Output: 15 (Decimal part lost)
    }
}
```
✔ **Explicit type casting (`(int)`) is needed because `i + f` results in a `float`.**

## 🔥 **Summary of Type Promotion Rules**
| Smaller Type  | Promoted To |
|--------------|------------|
| `byte` → `int` |
| `short` → `int` |
| `char` → `int` |
| `int` → `long` (if used with `long`) |
| `long` → `float` (if used with `float`) |
| `float` → `double` (if used with `double`) |

📌 **Always remember:** *Java ensures no precision loss in automatic promotions, but when converting back, precision might be lost!*  

---

## 🎯 **When to Use Type Promotion?**
✔ When performing **arithmetic operations** on mixed data types.  
✔ When **avoiding overflow or precision loss** in calculations.  
✔ When **dealing with expressions in loops and conditionals**.  

🚀 **Mastering type promotion helps avoid type conversion issues and ensures smooth numerical operations in Java!**
