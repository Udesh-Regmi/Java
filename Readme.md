# ðŸ“‚ **Java Applications Repository**

Welcome to my repository! This collection contains a comprehensive set of Java applications developed throughout my academic journey and other projects built using Java. The repository is organized into two main folders:

## 1. **College**
This folder includes:
- A curated collection of **Java programs** and **theoretical concepts** that were taught during my college coursework.
- **Lab assignments**, **projects**, and other related materials that reflect the core concepts and practical applications of Java as part of my academic curriculum.

## 2. **Projects**
This folder showcases:
- A range of **Java-based projects** that I have developed independently, applying advanced Java concepts to solve real-world problems.
- These projects demonstrate a deeper understanding of Java application development, covering various domains such as **object-oriented programming**, **data structures**, **algorithms**, and more.

Feel free to explore both folders to gain insights into my journey with Java programming.
