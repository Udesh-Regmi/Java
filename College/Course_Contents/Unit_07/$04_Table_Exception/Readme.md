### **Key Points to Remember:**
1. **Checked Exceptions**: These exceptions must be either caught or declared to be thrown using `throws` in the method signature. They represent recoverable conditions.
   
2. **Unchecked Exceptions**: These exceptions are subclasses of `RuntimeException` and occur during the runtime of the program. They typically represent programming errors that the developer should fix.

3. **Errors**: Errors are usually related to the JVM and its environment. These are serious issues (e.g., running out of memory) and are generally not recoverable by catching them.

### **Conclusion:**
Understanding the types of exceptions in Java is essential for writing robust programs. By using appropriate exception handling, you can make your application more fault-tolerant and user-friendly.
